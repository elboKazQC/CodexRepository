  "analysis": "The current configuration has resulted in frequent roaming events and high roaming handoff times. There are also multiple authentication failures and deauthentication requests, indicating instability in the Wi-Fi connection. The signal strength and noise floor values fluctuate significantly during roaming, leading to frequent disconnections and reconnections.",
  "changes": "The recommended changes aim to improve the roaming performance and overall stability of the Wi-Fi connection. By adjusting the roaming threshold value, roaming difference, transmission rate, transmission power, RTS threshold, and fragmentation threshold, the aim is to optimize the handoff process and reduce the number of roaming failures."
