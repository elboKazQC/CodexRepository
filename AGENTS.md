# Codex Collaboration Guidelines

These instructions apply to all directories in this repository.

- **Respect the modular structure** outlined in `AuditWifiApp/README.md`. Each feature lives in its own module.
- **Avoid global variables.** Keep functionality encapsulated within dedicated modules or classes.
- **Add comments** for every class and function so other developers can easily understand the code.
- **Run tests** with `pytest -v` before committing changes.
- **Dependencies** for the project are listed in `requirements.txt`.
