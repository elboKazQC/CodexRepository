# Forklift Inspection App

A minimal web application to record forklift inspections. It uses only the Python standard library, so no additional packages are required.

## Running the app

```bash
python ForkliftInspectionApp/server.py
```

Edit `config.yaml` to change where the CSV files are stored.
